# Remove redundant information
# If the log was properly identified and parsed, the data from the message field has been filed in separate fields.
# We no longer need the contents of the message field.
#
# Note, this is only being applied to bro logs that are going into separate indexes - if there isn't a separate index,
# someone needs to write one, and it would be more of a pain to not have access to the original message field in that
# scenario.

      remove_field => ["message"]
    }
